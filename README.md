# Word-Suggestion-using-NLP

The project aims to develop Auto-Suggest and Auto-Correct System using 
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in Python. Leveraging the 
textdistance library for measuring word similarity, pandas for data manipulation, 
and Flask for web interface creation, we provide users with intelligent 
suggestions based on their input.
